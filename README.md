# imageformats-ng
Concept of an new Qt Image Formats API

This repository is **deprecated** and exists only as a commit history.

Instead, new project exists - the [TextureViewer](https://github.com/ABBAPOH/textureviewer).
This project is limited to "texture" formats (dds, ktx, ...) and doesn't cover formats like gif or png; old imageformats API should be used.
